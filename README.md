The file 'pybank_main.py' is a Python script which aimed to analyze the financial data of the file 'budget_data.csv'.

The script has fulfilled five tasks in order by working out:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in Profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in Losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Although only five results have been presented, almost each step borrowed "print" function to confirm each action and calculation do right work as expected.
So suggest that when readers review the code, the function of "print" can also be used to help understand and check up the necesary of every step.
